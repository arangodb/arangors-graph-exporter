0.0.9 (2024-08-29)
-------------------

* RustTLS now being used.

0.0.8 (2024-08-22)
-------------------

* In case a user does not have permission to detect the ArangoDB environment
  related information, like e.g. the shardDistribution, right now we cannot
  detect which data loading strategy to choose from. In this case, we fallback
  to the AQL variant as this always works. Still, if the fallback happens,
  a warning message will be printed. Using the AQL variant will be slower
  compared to the dump strategy variant.
